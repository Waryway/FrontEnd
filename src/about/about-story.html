                WaryWay is the creation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylewiering">Kyle Wiering</a>.  Conceived in 2012, Waryway, is based on <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:14&version=KJV">Matthew 7:14</a>. There have been a few renditions of time, most of them based on trending technologies. The current approach uses <a href="https://aurelia.io">Aurelia IO</a>, a microservices backend based in PHP, and an <a href="https://onion.io/omega2/">Onion Omega 2</a> server. In other words - I don't have much of an electric bill to host my website.
